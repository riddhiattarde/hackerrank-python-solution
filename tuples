# Step 1: Input the number of elements in the tuple (though we don't really need to use it)
n = int(input())

# Step 2: Input the space-separated integers and create the tuple
t = tuple(map(int, input().split()))

# Step 3: Compute the hash of the tuple
result = hash(t)

# Step 4: Print the result
print(result)
